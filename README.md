# How to Run the Application

Udacity blog is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. It gets articles from four different sources, which can be selected in a menu. In order to be ran, the application needs to meet the following requirements:

1.  All feeds need to have a defined URL and name.
2.  The menu should not be visible when the page is loaded. It is showed when a hamburger menu (in the left hand corner) is clicked on.
3.  When the page is loaded, at least one Entry should be shown on the page.
4.  When new feed is loaded (a new source is selected from the menu), the content of the page must change.
